If you've ever watched Jimmy Kimmel you'll know what I mean. Try the other gelato creameries around town and save your money. However.

Both my children have life threatening food allergies and I was THRILLED at the prospect of a place that was safe for their combo of allergies. So much of this company's marketing touts it as vegan without highlighting that their baked goods contain EGGS. I'm very worried someone is going to miss this and end up hospitalized or worse.

I have seen the lady working there making a few of the same drink- wasn't enough for the last cup so she added ice to dilute it. That's unfair. On another occasion I've seen the lady use leftovers in the fridge, pour it in the blender and reblend it. Their drinks seem either too sweet or too diluted. Blenders are really loud you can't have a conversation! Have not seen a washroom in here either so you better hold it :/",2014-08-23 21:54:52,0

The both the chocolate and vanilla soft-serve have good flavor. Their cones are a nice size and they don't skimp on the sprinkles. Their prices are moderate - it won't break the bank to take the family out for ice cream cones. The service is always pleasant. I've been to both the walk-up window and the drive-through.

Sample. Sample. Sample.

Every ice cream, cake, chocolate piece is made from scratch. So sometimes the batches taste different. Seasonal ingredients leave room for variations in strength of taste and accuracy. SAMPLE YOUR FAVORITES JUST IN CASE THE BATCH IS NOT TO YOUR LIKING 

Less Busy during the weekday! 
3-6 is the best time to get served no hastle. Also that is happy hour on Floats (25% off!!)
